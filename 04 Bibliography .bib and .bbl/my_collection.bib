abstract = {Fee-for-service (FFS) contracts, first introduced in 2004, dramatically changed the way the pharmaceutical distribution supply chains are designed, managed, and operated. Investment buying (IB), forward buying in anticipation of drug price increases, used to be the way the distributors made most of their profits. FFS contracts limit the amount of inventory distributors can carry at any time (by imposing an inventory cap) and require inventory information sharing from the distributors to the manufacturers while compensating the distributors with a per-unit fee. In spite of its widespread popularity, the FFS model has never been rigorously analyzed or its effectiveness carefully tabulated. In this paper, we formulate the multiperiod stochastic inventory problems faced by the manufacturer and the distributor under the FFS and IB models, derive their optimal policies, and develop procedures to compute the policy parameters. We show that FFS contracts can improve the total supply chain profit-the manufacturer and distributor are now able to share a larger pie. Thus, there exists a range of the per-unit fees that leads to Pareto improvement. Simulation results show that such improvement is approximately 107{\%} on average, and as much as 505{\%}, and the improvement increases as the inventory cap decreases. Determining the Pareto-improving per-unit fees is a source of contention in FFS contract negotiation, and we propose a simple yet effective heuristic for computing them. Furthermore, supply chain transparency facilitated by the FFS contracts can significantly reduce the manufacturer's supply-demand mismatch costs (by approximately 3063{\%} on average and as much as 13001{\%}) and we show that the manufacturer should take advantage of this transparency especially when the inventory cap and drug price increase are high and demand variance is low. We believe that these results have the potential to improve the efficiency of pharmaceutical distribution supply chains, thus reducing the healthcare costs that are such a big burden on the U.S. economy. {\textcopyright} 2012 INFORMS.},

In this article, we present formulations for the strategic supply chain network design problem with dual objectives, which usually conflict with each other: minimizing cost and maximizing reliability. Quantifying the total reliability of a network design is not as straightforward as total cost calculation. We use reliability indices and develop analytical formulations that model the impact of upstream supply chain on individual entities' reliability to quantify the total reliability of a network. The resulting multiobjective nonlinear model is solved using a novel hybrid algorithm that utilizes a genetic algorithm for network design and linear programming for network flow optimization.

abstract = {This article seeks to offer a systematic approach to establishing a reliable network of facilities in closed loop supply chains (CLSCs) under uncertainties. Facilities that are located in this article concurrently satisfy both traditional objective functions and reliability considerations in CLSC network designs. To attack this problem, a novel mathematical model is developed that integrates the network design decisions in both forward and reverse supply chain networks. The model also utilizes an effective reliability approach to find a robust network design. In order to make the results of this article more realistic, a CLSC for a case study in the iron and steel industry has been explored. The considered CLSC is multi-echelon, multi-facility, multi-product and multi-supplier. Furthermore, multiple facilities exist in the reverse logistics network leading to high complexities. Since the collection centres play an important role in this network, the reliability concept of these facilities is taken into consideration. To solve the proposed model, a novel interactive hybrid solution methodology is developed by combining a number of efficient solution approaches from the recent literature. The proposed solution methodology is a bi-objective interval fuzzy possibilistic chance-constraint mixed integer linear programming (BOIFPCCMILP). Finally, computational experiments are provided to demonstrate the applicability and suitability of the proposed model in a supply chain environment and to help decision makers facilitate their analyses. {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

This paper proposes a reliable closed-loop supply chain network design model, which accounts for both partial and complete facility disruptions as well as the uncertainty in the critical input data. The proposed model is of mixed integer possibilistic linear programming type that aims to minimise simultaneously the total cost of opening new facilities and the expected cost of disruption scenarios. An enhanced possibilistic programming approach is proposed to deal with the epistemic uncertainty in input data. Furthermore, the p-robustness criterion is used to limit the cost of disruption scenarios and protect the designed network against random facility disruptions. Several numerical experiments along with sensitivity analyses on uncertain parameters are conducted to illustrate the significance and applicability of the developed model as well as the effectiveness of the proposed solution approach. Our results demonstrate that operational and disruption risks considerably affect the whole structure of the designed network and they must be taken into account when designing a reliable closed-loop logistics network.},

The model explores different production and distribution costs and tax rates at different locations in order to maximise the company's net profit value (NPV).Large instances of the model are not solvable in realistic time scales, so two decomposition algorithms were developed. In the first method, the supply chain is decomposed into independent primary and secondary subproblems, and each of them is optimised separately. The second algorithm is a temporal decomposition, where the main problem is separated into several independent subproblems, one per each time period. These algorithms enable the solution of large instances of the problem in reasonable time with good quality results. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {Recent events have highlighted the need for planners to consider the risk of disruptions when designing supply chain networks. Supply chain disruptions have a number of causes and may take a number of forms. Once a disruption occurs, there is very little recourse regarding supply chain infrastructure because these strategic decisions can- not be changed quickly. Therefore, it is critical to account for disruptions during the design of supply chain networks so that they perform well even after a disruption. Indeed, these systems can often be made substantially more reliable with only small additional investments in infrastructure. Planners have a range of options available to them in designing resilient supply chain networks, and their choice of approaches will depend on the financial resources available, the decision maker's risk preference, the type of network under consideration, and other factors. In this tutorial, we present a broad range of models for designing supply chains resilient to disruptions.We first cat- egorize these models by the status of the existing network: A network may be designed from scratch, or an existing network may be modified to prevent disruptions at some facilities. We next divide each category based on the underlying optimization model (facility location or network design) and the risk measure (expected cost or worst-case cost).},

In reality, however, facilities "fail" from time to time due to poor weather, labor actions, changes of ownership, or other factors. Such failures may lead to excessive transportation costs as customers must be served from facilities much farther than their regularly assigned facilities. In this paper, we present models for choosing facility locations to minimize cost, while also taking into account the expected transportation cost after failures of facilities. The goal is to choose facility locations that are both inexpensive under traditional objective functions and also reliable. This reliability approach is new in the facility location literature. We formulate reliability models based on both the PMP and the UFLP and present an optimal Lagrangian relaxation algorithm to solve them. We discuss how to use these models to generate a trade-off curve between the day-to-day operating cost and the expected cost, taking failures into account, and we use these trade-off curves to demonstrate empirically that substantial improvements in reliability are often possible with minimal increases in operating cost. {\textcopyright} 2005 INFORMS.},

abstract = {Supply chain optimisation is now a major research theme in process operations and management. A great deal of research has been undertaken on facility location and design, inventory and distribution planning, capacity and production planning and detailed scheduling. Only a small proportion of this work directly addresses the issues faced in the pharmaceutical sector. On the other hand, this sector is very much ready for and in need of sophisticated supply chain optimisation techniques. At the supply chain design stage, a particular problem faced by this industry is the need to balance future capacity with anticipated demands in the face of the very significant uncertainty that arises out of clinical trials and competitor activity. Efficient capacity utilisation plans and robust infrastructure investment decisions will be important as regulatory pressures increase and margins are eroded. The ability to locate nodes of the supply chain in tax havens and optimise trading and transfer price structures results in interesting degrees of freedom in the supply chain design problem. Prior even to capacity planning comes the problem of pipeline and testing planning, where the selection of products for development and the scheduling of the development tasks requires a careful management of risk and potential rewards. At the operation stage, it is often difficult to ensure responsiveness. Most pharmaceutical products involve primary active ingredient (AI) production (often multi-stage chemical synthesis or bioprocess) and secondary (formulation) production. Both of the stages are characterised by low manufacturing velocities and are hampered by the need for quality assurance activities at several points. It is not unusual for the overall supply chain cycle time to be 300 days. In this environment, supply chain debottlenecking and decoupling strategies together with co-ordinated inventory management are crucial for quick responses to changing market trends. A good understanding of what actually drives the supply chain dynamics is also required. As often as not, erratic dynamics are introduced by business processes rather than by external demand, and may be eliminated by the re-design of internal business processes or supplier/customer relationships. This paper will consider important issues in supply chain design and operation drawn from the literature and from our collaborative research projects in this area. The main features of the problems will be reviewed as will the literature to date. Some strategies for solution will be identified, as will some future research needs. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper studies a strategic supply chain management problem to design reliable networks that perform as well as possible under normal conditions, while also performing relatively well when disruptions strike. We present a mixed-integer programming model whose objective is to minimize the nominal cost (the cost when no disruptions occur) while reducing the disruption risk using the p-robustness criterion (which bounds the cost in disruption scenarios). We propose a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm that is based on genetic algorithms, local improvement, and the shortest augmenting path method. Numerical tests show that the heuristic greatly outperforms CPLEX in terms of solution speed, while still delivering excellent solution quality. We demonstrate the tradeoff between the nominal cost and system reliability, showing that substantial improvements in reliability are often possible with minimal increases in cost. We also show that our model produces solutions that are less conservative than those generated by common robustness measures. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This study presents an extension of the integrated Pharmaceutical Supply Chain design with maximum expected coverage, where different hospitals with specific reliability value for different pharmaceutical substances are considered. A four-layer multi-period supply chain including manufacturers, Distribution Centers, hospitals and patients is considered in this research. To increase the supply chain reliability, the pharmaceutical substance flow in each individual layer is allowed. Pharmaceutical substance's priority for each hospital varies according to its patients types. A reliability index for pharmaceutical substances is proposed to consider substances priority and improve the service level of hospitals for patients. A multi-objective model that increases demands' coverage and minimizes the total costs is developed. Centroid method is applied to handle demand uncertainty and a Multi-objective Non-dominated Ranked Genetic Algorithm is proposed to solve the model. This algorithm can generate a Pareto front with higher quality and better diversity when compared with Multiple Objective Particle Swarm Optimization and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II. As a case study, the proposed model is applied for the medical sector in the Fars province of Iran. Results show that when different reliability level for various pharmaceutical substances in different hospitals is considered, significantly better results in terms of unsatisfied demand without a significant increase in costs are obtained. In addition, the proposed approach is able to provide solutions to improve the supply chain reliability in a practical pharmaceutical supply network.},

@misc{Narayana2012,
abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to present a review of literature to assess the progress of research on managerial issues in the pharmaceutical industry globally. Design/methodology/approach: Literature from peer-reviewed journals available on online databases was collected for the last decade, using the keyword search technique, and then classifying it according to major managerial issues, research methodologies used and geographical zones. Findings: Behavioral issues at the consumer/physician level and non-behavioral issues in pricing and medical expenses are studied the most, followed by supply chain management, research and development and manufacturing and services operations management. There is scope for conjunction of research efforts across themes and players. The studies focus on the developed nations through the application of field research and mathematical modeling techniques. The studies in the American region focus more on development and marketing while studies in Europe are aligned towards manufacturing and distribution in the industry. Studies in the developing nations are mostly exploratory in nature and require more focus on issues of research and development and marketing in addition to a substantial increase in overall research efforts. More trans-continental studies are needed to consolidate research efforts globally. Research limitations/implications: The review is not exhaustive of all studies available on the industry and each of the issues. Conference papers, unpublished material and lectures were excluded. Practical implications: Identification of the present and emerging issues together provides practitioners in healthcare systems with an idea of available techniques and strategies to solve problems in healthcare/pharmaceutical management. Originality/value: A study on research of management issues in the pharmaceutical industry across the world has perhaps not been conducted in the recent past: this paper fills part of that gap. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

In this paper, we present a model that allows disruptions to be correlated with an uncertain joint distribution, and we apply distributionally robust optimization to minimize the expected cost under the worst-case distribution with given marginal disruption probabilities. The worst-case distribution has a practical interpretation with disruption propagation, and its sparse structure allows solving the problem efficiently. Our numerical results show that ignoring disruption correlation could lead to significant loss that increases dramatically in key factors such as source disaster probability, disruption propagation effect, and service interruption penalty. On the other hand, the robust model results in very low regret, even when disruptions are independent, and starts to outperform the model assuming independence when disruptions are mildly correlated. Most of the benefit of the robust model can be captured with a very low additional cost, which makes it easy to implement. Given these advantages, we believe that the robust model can serve as a promising alternative approach for solving reliable facility location problems.},

At the same time, the existing literature features very few studies which examine the impact of facility fortification for improving network reliability. In this paper, we present two related models for design of reliable distribution networks: a reliable P-median problem (RPMP) and a reliable uncapacitated fixed-charge location problem (RUFL). Both models consider heterogenous facility failure probabilities, one layer of supplier backup, and facility fortification within a finite budget. Both RPMP and RUFL are formulated as nonlinear integer programming models and proved to be NP-hard. We develop Lagrangian relaxation-based (LR) solution algorithms and demonstrate their computational efficiency. We compare the effectiveness of the LR-based solutions to that of the solutions obtained by a myopic policy which aims to fortify most reliable facilities regardless of the demand topology. Finally, we discuss an alternative way to assess the effectiveness of the design solutions by using the rate of return on fortification investment. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

For the operational inventory decision we provide the reorder point and order up to level (called. min and max par levels) that control the automated ordering system. These parameters are based on a near-optimal allocation policy of cycle stock and safety stock under storage space constraint. Tactical decision support focuses on the relevant tradeoffs amongst three key performance indicators: the expected number of daily refills, the service level, and the storage space utilization. We analyze the tradeoffs amongst the refill workload, the emergency workload, and the variety of drugs offered (called formulary).

The first category is concerned with uncertainty embedded in the model parameters, which affects the problem of balancing supply and demand. The second category of risks may arise from natural disasters, strikes and economic disruptions, terroristic acts, and etc. Most of the existing studies surveyed these types of risk, separately. This paper proposes a robust and reliable model for an integrated forward-reverse logistics network design, which simultaneously takes uncertain parameters and facility disruptions into account. The proposed model is formulated based on a recent robust optimization approach to protect the network against uncertainty. Furthermore, a mixed integer linear programing model with augmented p-robust constraints is proposed to control the reliability of the network among disruption scenarios. The objective function of the proposed model is minimizing the nominal cost, while reducing disruption risk using the p-robustness criterion. To study the behavior of the robustness and reliability of the concerned network, several numerical examples are considered. Finally, a comparative analysis is carried out to study the performance of the augmented p-robust criterion and other conventional robust criteria. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Existing literature in humanitarian aid supply chain management has not examined the impacts of disruption on timely and cost-efficient delivery of perishable products during disasters. This paper aims to contribute to fill this gap from a supply chain network design perspective. The supply chain network under investigation entails suppliers, mobile and fixed warehouses, distribution centers, and customers. A realistic problem is considered in which facilities and routes between them are subject to disruptions and might become inaccessible in the aftermath of disasters. We present a bi-objective robust optimization model that is resilient to disaster scenarios. The proposed model integrates strategic and tactical decisions and aims to minimize the time and cost of delivering products to customers after the occurrence of a disaster, while it considers the possibility of multiple disruptions in facilities and routes among them. A solution approach based on Lagrangian relaxation and $\epsilon$-constraint is developed to efficiently solve the bi-objective model. To validate the formulation and derive practical insights, we apply the proposed methodology to a real case study of blood supply chains. The resulting analyses focus on: (i) comparing the impacts of disruptions at different facilities and routes, (ii) examining the influence of planning for disruptions on the expected delivery time, (iii) investigating the effects of an increase in budget on the expected delivery time, and (iv) evaluating the performance of the proposed robust model and the solution approach.},

The resulting model formulation is a nonconvex mixed-integer 0-1 program, for which a tight linear programming relaxation is derived using RLT-based variable substitution strategies and a polyhedral outer-approximation technique. This LP relaxation is subsequently embedded within a specialized branch-and-bound procedure, and the proposed approach is proven to converge to a global optimum. Various alternative partitioning strategies that could potentially be employed in the context of this branch-and-bound framework, while preserving the theoretical convergence property, are also explored.

This paper proposes a compact mixed integer program (MIP) formulation and a continuum approximation (CA) model to study the reliable uncapacitated fixed charge location problem (RUFL), which seeks to minimize initial setup costs and expected transportation costs in normal and failure scenarios. The MIP determines the optimal facility locations as well as the optimal customer assignments and is solved using a custom-designed Lagrangian relaxation (LR) algorithm. The CA model predicts the total system cost without details about facility locations and customer assignments, and it provides a fast heuristic to find near-optimum solutions. Our computational results show that the LR algorithm is efficient for mid-sized RUFL problems and that the CA solutions are close to optimal in most of the test instances. For large-scale problems, the CA method is a good alternative to the LR algorithm that avoids prohibitively long running times. {\textcopyright} 2010 INFORMS.},

abstract = {This paper studied the design of a two-echelon supply chain where a set of suppliers serve a set of terminals that receive uncertain customer demands. In particular, we considered probabilistic transportation disruptions that may halt product supply from certain suppliers. We formulated this problem into an integer nonlinear program to determine the optimal system design that minimizes the expected total cost. A customized solution algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation was developed to efficiently solve this model. Several numerical examples were conducted to test the proposed model and draw managerial insights into how the key parameters affect the optimal system design.},

abstract = {One of the greatest challenges facing industry in the new century will be the process of selecting which new products to develop. Capital resources and manpower are limited. Stakeholders are demanding ever-increasing rates of return. These problems are especially difficult in highly regulated industries such as the chemicals and life sciences businesses, where development times are long and costly. In formative industries such as biotechnology, regulatory requirements continue to tighten, as public perception is often more influential than science in the approval process. Engineers are comfortable building process models, However, they infrequently think about the development of new products or the selection of new products as processes. This study is an attempt to get the engineers involved in the new product decision making process. Using the pharmaceutical industry as an example, probabilistic network models are used to capture all the activities and resources required in the 'process' of developing a new drug. The data representing each new product candidate are then combined into a simulation model of the new product development pipeline. This simulation model can be used by management to obtain insights into a new product portfolio, which will provide high rates of return at an acceptable level of exposure to risk for the corporation.

@article{Berman2007,
abstract = {In this paper, we analyze a facility location model where facilities may be subject to disruptions, causing customers to seek service from the operating facilities. We generalize the classical p-median problem on a network to explicitly include the failure probabilities, and analyze structural and algorithmic aspects of the resulting model. The optimal location patterns are seen to be strongly dependent on the probability of facility failure, with facilities becoming more centralized, or even co-located, as the failure probability grows. Several exact and heuristic solution approaches are developed. Results of numerical experiments are reported. {\textcopyright} 2007 INFORMS.},

abstract = {Healthcare facility (HCF) location has attracted considerable attention from the operations research community over nearly four decades as one of the most important strategic issues in healthcare systems, disaster management, and humanitarian logistics. However, the lack of a comprehensive review in the last decade is a serious shortcoming in the literature of HCF location. This survey presents a framework to classify different types of non-emergency and emergency HCFs in terms of location management, and reviews the literature based on the framework. The papers on HCF location problems are classified in detailed tables along ten descriptive dimensions, which are consideration of uncertainty, multi-period setting, particular input/setting, objective function, decision variable, constraint, basic discrete location problem, mathematical modeling approach, solution method, and case study inclusion. For each HCF type, research gaps and possible future directions are identified. Moreover, the literature and future research possibilities are analyzed in terms of modeling approach and solution method.},

abstract = {The right to health as a basic human right- and access to medicine as a part of it- have been a matter of attention for several decades. Also the responsibilities of different parties- particularly pharmaceutical companies- in realization of this right has been emphasized by World Health Organization. This is while many companies find no incentive for research and development of medicines related to rare diseases. Also some legal structures such as "patent agreements" clearly cause huge difficulties for access to medicine in many countries. High prices of brand medicine and no legal production of generics can increase the catastrophic costs- as well as morbidity-mortality of medication in lower income countries. Here we evidently review the current challenges in access to medicine and critically assess its legal roots. How societies/governors can make the pharmaceutical companies responsible is also discussed to have a look on possible future and actions that policy makers- in local or global level- can take.

abstract = {Sustainable development of a nation greatly depends on the health of individuals. The emergence of the diseases caused by unhealthy lifestyle as well as the growth and aging of the population have faced the pharmaceutical industry with an increasing demand for drugs and the related products over time. This increase in demand has made the pharmaceutical industry as an important and large industry which constitutes a considerable portion of the healthcare expenditures. This sector is grappling with many challenges and inefficiencies in research and development activities, introducing new products, procurement, manufacturing, storage, and distribution affairs. Such issues have resulted in the inability of pharmaceutical companies to satisfy market demand in an efficient while effective manner. These problems alongside the dynamic and complex nature of a pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC) necessitate the employment of efficient optimization techniques to provide these companies with informed decision making by relying on available data. Hence, this chapter aims to identify the prevalent challenges of PSCs at three different decision levels, i.e., long-term (strategic), mid-term (tactical), and short-term (operational) decisions; as well as presenting various ways to deal with such problems. Accordingly, first, the characteristics of a PSC are presented and discussed. In order to provide a tangible perspective for application of Operations Research in PSC, an exhaustive mathematical programming model is presented. Then, a real practical case study is described and investigated and a number of avenues for further research are finally suggested.},
